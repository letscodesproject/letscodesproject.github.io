<p>But it’s not who you are underneath… it’s what you do that defines you.</p>
<p>Just you, sir? Don’t worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.</p>
<p>You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting.</p>
<p>Okay. Now… Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped, tri-weave fibers for flexibility. You’ll be lighter, faster, more agile.</p>
<p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you’ve truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra’s Al Ghul’s destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is… ashes Then you have my permission to die.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.</p>
